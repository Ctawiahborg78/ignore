          <h3>Firstly </h3>
          <p>
            I would like to apologise for not playing Fortnite with you. My actions led to your frustration and disappointment on your part. I am very sorry for hurting you. Firstly, I'm sorry for agreeing to play whilst tired and leaving you waiting for me. I apologise for not responding to your messages on time, it seemed like I was disregarding your messages, which was not my intention. Also, when you didn't reply back after I said I was eating, I mistakenly assumed you were not interested in playing anymore. I realise now how this assumption was wrong and led to further confusion and disappointment. I am sorry that my lack of communication led to this. I really value our time together and I know you wanted to spend time with me as you would be busy the rest of this week and for the rest of month maybe. In the future, I'll make sure to commnicate more clearly and promptly, so as to avoid shit like this.
          </p>

          <h3>Secondly </h3>
          <p>
           I miss you, and I hate the fact that you are ignoring me rn. We have been through worse, and we were able to patch things up again and resume as usual in no time. But right now I'm being ignored like I don't exist and I want to communicate and push past this like we always do, minor setback major comeback. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>However </h3>
          <p>
            If you don't wanna talk to me no more abeg just communicate that to me and not just ignore my existence. I know you are busy now with your internship but can you at least tell me you don't want to talk to me no more. Lol my good morning and good nights get aired like they weren't sent and you aired the first website I made. If you want to ignore me ight, but tell me so I know whats going on please, im not tryna seem annoying or be a beg.

             Cassi is the prettiest woman I've ever laid my eyes upon. She is the embodiment of beauty and grace. I am so lucky to have her in my life. I love you Cassi.
